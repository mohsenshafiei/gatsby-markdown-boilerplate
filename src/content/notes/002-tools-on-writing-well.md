I read the freeCodeCamp [How to get published in the freeCodeCamp Medium publication](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-to-get-published-in-the-freecodecamp-medium-publication-9b342a22400e#d568) article. Here are the best gems that I found in this article.

The headline is an essential part of writing, and you must choose the headline carefully. When you want to come up with a good headline:
- Don’t use clickbait.
- Don’t use listicles.
- Tell the truth.


HubSpot analyzed 6,000 blog posts and found that stories with *8 to 14* word headlines get more social media shares. This said, *make sure your headline is 80 characters or fewer*. Otherwise, the title will get truncated in the news feeds when people share your article on Facebook and Twitter.

[Headline Analyzer](https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer) is a tool that helps you to choose your headline wisely.


If you have trouble coming up with at least 5 minutes worth of things to say on a topic — or if your story devolves into a list of bullet points — you don’t know enough about it.

If you’re looking for images you can safely use without permission, check out [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), or search Google for images labeled for re-use.

Where possible, code should be in text form rather than images. This makes the code more accessible to screen readers and more comfortable for people to copy and paste.

You can also use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) app to make your writings grammatically correct.
