I read "[Found money startups](https://www.swyx.io/found-money/)" blog post written by [Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/). I highly recommend following his blog if you want to learn some great stuff. He is actively posting fantastic blog posts and ideas. I learned a ton from his blog, and his style of writing and personality are outstanding.

Based on Shawn blog post, these startups will find the money for people. They can move fast and overgrow.

One naive and excellent example of these startups is "Finding money on the sides of buildings,". In other words, the company offers to sell ads for building owners.

At the end of the blog post, Shawn has mentioned the startups [here](https://www.swyx.io/found-money/#examples-of-found-money-startups). My favorite found money startup is Honey. I couldn't imagine how simple the idea is and how significant the impact can be. [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/trending/stores) is a chrome extension that finds money by automatically applying coupons for you. Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy!
