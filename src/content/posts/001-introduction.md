I created this website two years ago, and since then, I have always wanted to write my thoughts and publish them somewhere.
Every time I found excuses and postponed it. This year I studied and practiced to become better at writing. I read four books like "[On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B0090RVGW0/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=on+writing+well&qid=1604223064&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)" by William Zinsser, "[100 ways to improve your writings](https://www.amazon.com/Ways-Improve-Your-Writing-Updated-ebook/dp/B07H1V584S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CQ9MUQ3BBEW&dchild=1&keywords=100+ways+to+improve+your+writing&qid=1604223087&s=digital-text&sprefix=100+ways+%2Cdigital-text%2C496&sr=1-1)" by Gary Provost, "[The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk-ebook/dp/B07NPN5HTP/ref=sr_1_1?crid=OCAIAEL50196&dchild=1&keywords=the+elements+of+style&qid=1604223113&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+element%2Cdigital-text%2C364&sr=1-1)" by William Strunk Jr and also "[Both Sides of Context: Insoo Va Ansoo-ye Matn](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1780832680/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i6)" by famous Persian writer Abbas Maroufi. I also watched some courses like "[Gardoon Academy](https://www.youtube.com/c/GardoonAcademy/videos)" by Abbas Maroufi and also watched [Jerry B. Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/user/NovelistJerryJenkins/videos) youtube channel videos.

When we read other writers' essays or books, we assume it must be easy to write. However, when we start to write, we stare at a blank paper for a long time, and in the end, we cannot write anything, and then we give up. I learned that this phenomenon is pretty OK, and every writer experiences and suffer from it. Writing is an art, and like music, painting, and dancing, we need to study and prepare for it. People cannot write for different reasons that I will share my thoughts about them in another post. Finally, to become a better writer, you must acquire critical thinking, creativity, punctuation, and grammar skills and sharpen your vocabulary knowledge.

After all, I achieved some skills, and I am going to start my writing journey. To begin and get the habit of writing regularly, I will publish some technical posts and maybe some Persian short stories. These technical posts are related to the frontend and the skills that I achieved during my professional career.
