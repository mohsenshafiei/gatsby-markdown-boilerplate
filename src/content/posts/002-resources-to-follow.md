I believe our knowledge depends on the people we know, follow, communicate and work with, books, blogs that we read, and our capability to store, remember, connect, and process the information. 

Recently I am looking for those young-minded people on the internet that are sharing great wisdom. This post is ongoing, and every time I will try to update this page. Here are 

- [Shawn @SWYX Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) is a great speaker and engineer at AWS who shares his thoughts, writing, and excellent knowledge about tech, startups, coding career, etc.
- [Li Hau Tan](https://lihautan.com/) is one of the best engineers and a fantastic friend that I know personally. He is a core maintainer of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). He is so young and full of fresh ideas, and you will find many gems in his blog and his [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmC3HP3FaAFdcZkui8YoMQ) channel.
- [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) is a self-taught designer and developer. She is super creative, and you can learn and get inspired by her work.
- [Wei Gao](https://aworkinprogress.dev/) is the host of [Singapore React Knowledgeable](https://reactknowledgeable.org/) and also the maintainer of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). She posts fresh and unique content about different topics and technologies related to frontend developement.
