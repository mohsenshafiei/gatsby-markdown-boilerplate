I created this website two years ago, and since then, I have always wanted to write my thoughts and publish them somewhere.
Every time I found excuses and postponed it. This year I studied and practiced to become better at writing. I read two or three books like "On Writing Well" by William Zinsser, "100 ways to improve your writings" by Gary Provost and "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk Jr. I also watched some courses like "Gardoon Academy" by famous Persian writer Abbas Maaroufi and also watched Jerry B. Jenkins youtube channel.

After all, I achieved some skills, and I am going to start my writing journey. Therefore, to begin and also get the habit of writing regularly, I will publish some technical posts and maybe some Persian short stories. These technical posts are related to the frontend and the skills that I achieved during my professional career.
